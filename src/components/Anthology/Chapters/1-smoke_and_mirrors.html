<p></p><p></p><p>I was staying in a rickety old inn, down in that rundown part of Eppinhoff near the docks. It was a real dive; I could hardly sleep from the bedbugs. It’s not like I couldn’t afford anywhere better – I had plenty of gold – but it was the only place desperate enough to take goblins. To be fair, it was fine for my purposes; nobody would come looking for me in a shithole like that, and I was trying to lay low whilst I gathered supplies. I had allowed myself two days preparation before leaving for Rosefall. I amended that to two hours once I heard Evangeline was in town.</p><p></p><p>I knew she was there for the same job as me. In our industry, there’s no avoiding it; if one Hag gets a tip, they all do. Don’t ask me how, they have their ways. Knowing things is the name of the game. The next most important thing is speed. If she beat me to Rosefall, I knew I’d be left empty handed.</p><p></p><p>I tipped my informant generously and hurried to the farmer’s market. It was the most popular in Epinhoff, and it was heaving with people hungry for dinner. I lingered at the edges, so as not to get trampled (humans are so tall, and so clumsy with their feet). I tried to get food, but every stall swatted me away with disgust. A rat would have been more welcome than a goblin. I finally bought a soggy, lukewarm pastry from a kind halfling with sad eyes. I chowed down and moved on quickly. Traders and merchants were in the next square over; I could only hope their gag reflexes were stronger.</p><p></p><p>As I exited a throughway to get to the square, I saw a dark little herbalism shop between a baker’s and butcher’s. I peered in through the window, but could see only my own reflection. Shit, I thought. Already closed. But as I cursed, something in the reflection of the square caught my eye. A face stood out from the rest of the crowd. Evangeline fucking Whiteheart. My heart froze. I spun around and looked at her. She hadn’t seen me, but I stared for too long, and my gaze drew hers. Her face lit up at the sight of me, and she bounded over like a puppy.</p><p></p><p>I looked her up and down as she approached. It made me sick to my stomach.</p><p></p><p>Crystal blue eyes shone atop her perfectly cut cheekbones, framed by luscious golden locks cascading down to her hips. Rosy cheeks blushed through her dainty pale complexion, and, to top it all off, she had a smile to die for. It could surely melt the heart of any man, no matter how callous.</p><p></p><p>But I wasn’t a man, and I wasn’t nearly so stupid. I was a goblin, and I saw through her gorgeous, perfect, ridiculously hot facade, all the way down to the hideous, revolting, piece-of-shit personality hidden underneath. It would reveal itself any second now. I knew it.</p><p></p><p>“Hi, Jinx!” she said excitedly. “How have you been?” Her smile was beaming, and her eyes were gleaming. She fluttered her eyelashes, and my heart fluttered with them. Not today, Mephistopheles.</p><p></p><p>“Yeah, yeah. Spare me the pleasantries, you roach,” I replied. My goblin shriek was unpleasantly highlighted by the softness of her voice. “What are you doing here? Collecting children’s tears for supper?”</p><p></p><p>She looked hurt, but I reminded myself that monsters don’t have feelings. “I see you’re still upset with me. I was afraid you might be.” She averted her eyes in shame. “I’m sorry about what happened, Jinx. I really am. But you know you would have done the same. Please, let’s just put it behind us. I desperately want to fix this.”</p><p></p><p>“Fix my ass,” I said, and cocked a leg as I ripped a fart. Perfect timing, as it was slipping out anyway.</p><p></p><p>Still, she remained earnest. “You know, I’ve thought a lot about you since our last encounter. I almost reached out a few times, but… I didn’t have the courage. I worried it would make you angry.”</p><p></p><p>“Yet here you are, glued to my tail like a tick to a dog.”</p><p></p><p>“No, Jinx! It’s not like that at all,” she said, taken aback. “I’m not following you.”</p><p></p><p>“Said every stalker ever.”</p><p></p><p>She smiled. “Be that as it may, I swear that I’m not. I’m here to stock up and rest. Things have been... heated lately. Well, you know what I mean. I’m laying low for a while, trying to stay out of trouble. I guess you’re doing the same.”</p><p></p><p>“Yeah. Pretty much.” We were both lying, and we both knew it. It’s a strange thing when you know each other as we did; it was as though we could read each other’s thoughts. I’d predict her every move, her predictions about mine, and her predictions about my predictions. It was like pointing two mirrors at one another; there was no end to the complexity.</p><p></p><p>Then it occurred to me that she might actually be reading my thoughts. Balls! I thought loudly. Big hairy balls! Her lips curled up slightly.</p><p></p><p>“Anyway,” I continued, “I can’t say it’s been a pleasure, but I’ve got things to do. Hopefully see you never, though I highly doubt it.” I pushed past her through a cloud of floral perfume.</p><p></p><p>“See you later, Jinx!” she chirped.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p></p><p>I suppressed my thoughts as I walked away, still fearing she might be listening. A devious plan was forming in my mind, but I’d have to act fast for it to work. I plucked a single brown hair from the head of a pretty woman walking past, and skulked away as she scratched at her scalp.</p><p></p><p>There was an alley nearby with a thick stone arch that bridged between two overhanging buildings (and looked suspiciously critical to their structural integrity). Decorative ridges lined the arch, and the surrounding walls were rough stone. They were no match for my goblin claws. I scampered up a wall and hid atop the arch. It was just wide enough to obscure me from the adjacent street below.</p><p></p><p>I unpacked spell components from my backpack, and laid them out across the dusty stone. It was a simple spell, and it only took a minute. I placed the hair I had stolen into a vial of weak acid, and whilst it dissolved I used my pestle and mortar to make a balm of dried lizard skin and squid ink. Then I mixed it all together into a thick, dark paste and spread it across my face, ears and claws. The acid stung my cheeks. I read arcane words from my spellbook to activate the paste, and it spread across my eyes and mouth, clinging to my jaw and stretching around my ears. For a moment, the film engulfed my head entirely, and I swallowed back panic as it blocked off my airways. It writhed and tugged on my skin, peeling flesh from bone and rearranging as necessary. I resisted the urge to scream. Finally it settled, and I peeled the black film off my face. I looked into my handmirror, and a handsome woman looked back.</p><p></p><p>Being human was advantageous in many ways, but one thing they are terrible at is climbing. I began to lower myself from the arch, carefully and slowly, but my soft, delicate hands immediately lost traction and I fell, splashing into the mud like a sack of wet shit. A group of children doubled over in laughter across the street.</p><p></p><p>“Fuck you!” I screamed as I clambered to my feet. I must have looked very unhinged, because they ran as I stamped in their direction.</p><p></p><p>I headed back to the square and immediately saw Evangeline. She was laughing with one of the merchants. Flirting for a discount, no doubt. I pottered around the market, making use of the opportunity to buy food and supplies. Then I tailed her when she left.</p><p></p><p>We walked for a half-mile before reaching the posh part of town. It was a nice change of pace for me; I tended to operate in the rougher areas. Desperation was good for business. I rarely had occasion to go somewhere that fancy, and, even if I did, I usually wasn’t welcome. I made the most of my human face and poked it into a bookshop whilst Evangeline stopped at a tailor’s. It was a wonderful little place, and I longed to lose myself amongst its shelves, but I dared not lose Evangeline.</p><p></p><p>As the sun was setting, we arrived at her abode. The Golden Goose Inn. Classic Evangeline. Never one to forgo luxury, Evangeline enjoyed fine things like a magpie enjoys shiny things. Their brains were similar in size, so it made perfect sense. I walked on past to avoid raising suspicion, then looped back once it was dark to set up camp.</p><p></p><p>It was a good ol’ fashioned stakeout. Not only would I get to keep tabs on Evangeline’s whereabouts, but whilst she was asleep I could climb up to her window and enchant her. Nothing malicious; just an extra dose of beauty sleep. If I could get a half-day’s lead on her, I’d be leaving Rosefall by the time she arrived. I would have loved to see the panic on her face when she realised she’d overslept.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it didn’t work out that way. It was a long, boring night, and my nook was so cosy compared to the flea-riddled haystack I’d grown accustomed to. I couldn’t help but shut my eyes.</p><p></p><p>I awoke to birdsong. The first golden rays of dawn spilled across the inn, painting colour into its gardens and walls. There were no singing children, but it was a beautiful place nonetheless. I felt better waking up there than I’d felt in weeks. That must be how Evangeline felt every day, the spoilt cow. And then my heart stopped. Evangeline.</p><p></p><p>I jumped to my feet, and realised what had happened. That tricksy bitch must have used my own plan against me. She had the nerve to enchant me! I couldn’t believe it. In my mind, there was zero chance it was my fault. I never slept that soundly, and it was never a coincidence with Evangeline.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p></p><p>It was two day’s travel to Rosefall. I paid a hefty sum for the coachman to push his horses to the limit, in the hopes of regaining a few hours. He grunted disgruntledly as he accepted my gold. He was the grunting type.</p><p></p><p>It was a surprisingly uneventful journey. As we crossed the border of Rosefall into the shadow of its permanent overcast, I straightened up and kept careful watch. Traveling through Rosefall is risky for the best of us; with just myself and the coachman, we wouldn’t have stood a chance against an attack. Fortunately, the estate wasn’t too far from the border. The vampire who had lived there was young, and too low status to live in Rosefall’s centre.</p><p></p><p>We crested a ridge that encompassed a forest far below, and in the centre of the forest was a clearing around the estate.</p><p></p><p>The horses stopped, and the coachman grunted.</p><p></p><p>“Why are you stopping?” I asked. “Can’t we get a bit closer?”</p><p></p><p>He looked at me with half-lidded, dead-inside eyes. I understood perfectly.</p><p></p><p>The walk down the ridge wasn’t a difficult one, but I was impatient to arrive and my rushing exhausted me. I was already winded when I reached the wood’s edge, and my anxiety whilst navigating alone spurred me even faster. It was eerily quiet for a forest; there was not even a wind. By the time I reached the estate, I was panting hard and sweating.</p><p></p><p>But the estate is what really took my breath away. It was magnificent. An army of gargoyles stared down from a black gothic crown of sharply-peaked roofs, which were perched atop several intricate stone arches which formed a shell around a black wooden core. A hundred terraced windows peppered the front of the mansion, both without and within the arches, and a mighty wooden gate sealed its front, shutting it off from the rest of the world. An entire army could live there by my reckoning. I could hardly fathom the loneliness of a sole occupant.</p><p></p><p>I cracked the front gate open, and slipped in without a sound. As I crossed the threshold, goosebumps ran up my arms from the deathly cold air, and then my ears began to ring. If the woodland’s silence was eerie, the mansion’s was sinister. I struggled to stifle the sound of my cloud-filled breath.</p><p></p><p>The interior somehow surpassed the exterior’s grandiosity, but at the same time it was missing something. I couldn’t put my finger on it. It was soulless somehow. A great crystal chandelier hung from the distant ceiling, its twinkling light dancing across glassy water in an elevated bowl at the room’s centre. Dark wooden gates gaped open behind it, wrapped on each side by twin marble staircases leading up to a mezzanine. I headed for the open gate. I moved as quietly as I could (which is pretty damn quietly), but the clicking of my claws on marble floor echoed all around the foyer with each step.</p><p></p><p>The gate lead to a cavernous dining hall. Three ebony dining tables stretched towards a dais at the far end of the hall where a black metal throne looked out across its subjects. As I looked around, I could almost see the ghosts of vampiric parties past. Surely some atrocious acts were committed, but I still felt a pang of longing to attend. The entire mansion embodied an aesthetic that I found deeply pleasing, and I would have loved to admire the attendents’s attire.</p><p></p><p>As I paced the empty corridors, my hunched shoulders began to relax. The living rooms were numerous and lux, and the guest bedrooms were divine (or whatever the vampiric equivalent is). Most rooms were one of those two – but I also found a phenomenal library in the far eastern wing. It was within a building constructed earlier than the rest of the house, that much was clear from its crumbling stone walls. It had much lower ceilings, and it was cramped and busy with bookcases. I could have spent a lifetime there. I’m sure some lucky vampire had spent several. But I couldn’t waste too much time; I was acutely aware of how undisturbed the house was, and I still held out hope that I might be the first one there. I scanned the collection of books, bagged the most promising ones, and moved on.</p><p></p><p>I looped back to the central body of the estate, and began working my way upwards. Spiral staircases pinned each corner of the great hall. They lead to a balcony that overlooked the hall from all sides, and several enclosed nooks jutted off from it, presumably for the private enjoyment of groups. As I kept going up, there was a clear threshold between the dark wooden core of the house and the stone upper shell. Only one room occupied both layers, part wood and part stone, suspended at a half level between them that interrupted the structure of every adjacent room. Such an extravagant signal of significance made it easy to guess its contents. I stepped inside the master bedroom.</p><p></p><p>I have always wondered whether vampires truly slept in coffins. It’s a load of bullshit; the bed in there would have filled any ordinary sized room. But this room was not ordinary sized; it was as extravagantly spacious as the rest of the house. Across from the bed was a large archway that looked like another room, but on closer examination it was just an impeccably clean mirror.  Dotted around the other walls were dozens of small staggered shelves, clearly intended to hold ornaments and trinkets – but, to my dismay, there were all completely empty. Perhaps I was too late.</p><p></p><p> I checked the chests, I checked the wardrobe, I checked every desk drawer. Nothing. But as I gazed around the room in desperation, something caught my eye in the huge arched mirror: a single fishbowl, brimmed with water on a shelf. I turned around to find it. But there was nothing there. I looked from it, to the mirror, and back again, and asked myself if I was going crazy. There was definitely a fishbowl in the mirror that wasn’t in the room. I pushed myself right up against the mirror to get a closer look.</p><p></p><p>And then I saw my worst nightmare.</p><p></p><p>Evangeline jumped out behind me and screamed.</p><p></p><p>I jumped away from the mirror in fright, and cursed myself for startling so badly. She was incapacitated with laughter, and I turned around to face her.</p><p></p><p>But she wasn’t there.</p><p></p><p>I turned back to the mirror, and there she was, right over my shoulder. I double took again. “What the fuck is going on?” I drawled.</p><p></p><p>“You should have seen your face, Jinx!” she said through fits of giggles. “I’ve never seen someone look so scared!”</p><p></p><p>“Well you must be a very shitty Witch then,” I spat. I looked around to try and make sense of everything. It still made no sense. “Evangeline... Why are you in the mirror? How are you in the mirror?”</p><p></p><p>“Ah,” she said, tapping her nose with a smug grin. “Tricks of the trade, my friend. Would you like to come in?”</p><p></p><p>I stood dumbfounded for a second. “Well... yeah.” And she beckoned me to join her.</p><p></p><p>I walked straight at the mirror.</p><p></p><p>My head bounced off it like a toddler, sending Evangeline into more fits of laughter. “No, dummy!” she said. “Not like that! Your reflection’s in the way.”</p><p></p><p>I stood dumbfounded once more. Was I having a stroke? Why did she think any of that made sense?</p><p></p><p>“Well how do I get it out the fucking way?” Anger fluttered about in my chest. She was making a fool out of me. Stupid, bird-brained Evangeline thought I was stupid.</p><p></p><p>“How would a vampire do it?” she said.</p><p></p><p>I thought for a moment. “I don’t know. Aren’t they born without reflections?”</p><p></p><p>She shrugged. “Maybe. I’ve never seen one before.”</p><p></p><p>“Well, how am I meant to do it?” I asked.</p><p></p><p>“Your reflection does whatever you do. And you need to make your reflection disappear. Soooo…”</p><p></p><p>“So what? Move myself out the way? Disappear myself? What does that even mean?”</p><p></p><p>She touched her nose, pointed at me, and bounced up and down with glee. “Yes! That’s it! Disappear yourself!”</p><p></p><p>“I’ll disappear you in a minute you fucking-” I paused. Cogs turned in my head. It took far too long for them to click into place.</p><p></p><p>“Ah,” I said. “I see.”</p><p></p><p>Evangeline clapped in delight.</p><p></p><p>I removed spell components from my bag and set them out across the floorboards. After a minute of arranging and reciting from my spellbook, I turned myself invisible.</p><p></p><p>And then I walked through the mirror.</p><p></p><p>Evangeline clapped more with a  beaming smile on her face. “You did it! This is so much fun!”</p><p></p><p>I dropped my invisibility and looked back at the mirror behind me. There was no reflection. “Yeah,” I admitted. “This is pretty cool.”</p><p></p><p>I looked around the room. It was still barren, except for a fishbowl on one shelf, and a scroll on a chest next to the mirror.</p><p></p><p>And a huge bulging sack in the corner.</p><p></p><p>“Um. Evangeline…” I said tentatively. “Is that yours?”</p><p></p><p>“Yep!” she said with a proud grin.</p><p></p><p>“Did you stuff it full of loot from the shelves?”</p><p></p><p>“That’s right!” she said again proudly.</p><p></p><p>“Urm… okay.” I gulped. “And… are you going to share any of it with me?”</p><p></p><p>She gave me a knowing look. “Oh, Jinx. Of course I am. We’re friends after all, right?”</p><p></p><p>I paused. Then I forced myself to say it. “Yeah. That’s right.”</p><p></p><p>“Best of friends. Right?”</p><p></p><p>I paused again, and thought to myself, Are you fucking insane?! We’re mortal fucking enemies! Then I said, “That’s right. We’re best of friends.”</p><p></p><p>“Good.” She smiled, seemingly satisfied. “I know how hard that was for you to say, but I appreciate the kind words. I just need your help with one more thing before we leave. Can you help me with that fishbowl over there?”</p><p></p><p>“That one?” I turned around to face it. “But it’s empty.”</p><p></p><p>“Yeah, I know it looks that way. But there’s something in the water, and I can’t get it out.”</p><p></p><p>“Oh… okay. Cool.” I walked towards the fish bowl. Is this a bad idea? I wondered. More nonsense reflective shenanigans, perhaps? I didn’t really have much choice; she had all the loot. Until she handed some over, I was basically her bitch.</p><p></p><p>I stood in front of the fish bowl.</p><p></p><p>I leaned over it, and peered into the water.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing there.</p><p></p><p>“Evangeline,” I said. “Are you sure there’s something in here? You know, other than water?”</p><p></p><p>“Yep! Just pop back over here for a sec.”</p><p></p><p>“Kay.”</p><p></p><p>I walked back to Evangeline in a daze. My cloak was slightly damp.</p><p></p><p>“I’m going to need you to trust me now, Jinx,” she said slowly. “There’s something inside you, and I’m going to pull it out.”</p><p></p><p>My eyes bulged. “What? What are you talking about?”</p><p></p><p>“Something got into your brain, and I’m going to pull it out. Hold still.”</p><p></p><p>“What?! Wait a sec-”</p><p></p><p>She put her hand up to my face, and cast a spell.</p><p></p><p>I felt something dislodge in the top of my nose. Like a giant snot-ball I hadn’t noticed. It was bulging and slimy and tasted like metal.</p><p></p><p>And then it started to writhe.</p><p></p><p>I screamed. My eyes went wide. Blind panic seized my heart. I had no idea what she was doing, but there was definitely something in my nose.</p><p></p><p>“Get it out! Get it out!” I screamed at her.</p><p></p><p>“I’m trying! Hold still!”</p><p></p><p>I felt pressure build, and pain well up. I felt the crunching and crackling of cartilage moving. Then, finally, in a mighty explosion of thick snot and blood, a gelatin ball erupted from my nose. Evangeline caught it in one hand.</p><p></p><p>“Fuck!” I screamed, clasping my nose. Blood was pouring out.</p><p></p><p>“Yikes,” said Evangeline. “That was worse than I thought. Sorry about that, Jinx.”</p><p></p><p>“What the fuck was that?!” I screamed.</p><p></p><p>“It’s called a mind maggot. See here?” She held up a watery transparent blob in front of me. It had four tiny black dots on one end. Presumably eyes.</p><p></p><p>“What the fuck? What is that?”</p><p></p><p>“It’s a funny little creature,” she said casually, as though she were presenting at girl scouts. “It’s a parasite occasionally found in stagnant bodies of water in the Underdark. It forces its way up the host’s nose towards the brain, and extends antennae into the brain stem. Once it has access to the brain, it can alter your memories. The first thing it does is make you forget what happened – and then you don’t stand a chance of removing it! It can make you do whatever it needs in order to reproduce, and all the while you have no idea it’s even there.” She beamed at me. “Pretty cool, huh?”</p><p></p><p>I looked at her blankly. The top of my nose was throbbing with pain.</p><p></p><p>I threw up.</p><p></p><p>When I stood back up, Evangeline was looking at me with pure sympathy. I appreciated that.</p><p></p><p>“So,” I croaked hoarsely, “if you’ve had your fun, shall we split up that loot now?”</p><p></p><p>“Sure,” she said with a smile. She walked over to her sack and pulled out a metal canister. “Yours is over there.” She pointed at the scroll on the chest of drawers, then opened the canister, and smoke poured out.</p><p></p><p>I blacked out.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p></p><p>There was a knocking sound. I opened my eyes, and looked around for its source. There was a party of five adventurers staring at me from the far side of the mirror, and their reflections stood nearby.</p><p></p><p>“We’re, urr… looking for the vampire’s stuff,” said a particularly burly one. “You wouldn’t know where that is, would ya?”</p><p></p><p>I looked around in a daze. Splatters of my blood were dried onto the floorboards. The empty fishbowl was still on its shelf. But Evangeline and her sack were gone.</p><p></p><p>I stood up, and walked towards the chest of drawers. I looked across the party as I went. They were carrying an awful lot of weapons. An awful lot.</p><p></p><p>“Hey. Did you hear us, goblin?” said a dwarf with a huge hammer.</p><p></p><p>I picked up the scroll on the chest. It was a spell scroll. Teleport. There was a note clipped to its front, which said:</p><p></p><p>“Sorry! :p hehe x”</p><p></p><p>I tossed my head back, and groaned loudly. It reverberated in the depths of my soul. Embarrassed, swindled, and patronised with charity. I hated myself vehemently. It was the lowest point in my career. I swore to myself that I would destroy Evangeline Whiteheart.</p><p></p><p>“Wait... Stop!” the dwarf objected as I read aloud the words on the scroll.</p><p></p><p>It burnt up in a blinding flash of green light. And then I was gone.</p>
