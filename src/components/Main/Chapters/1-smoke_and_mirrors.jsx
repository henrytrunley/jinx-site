I’d read her message half a dozen times, but I had to be sure I wasn’t forgetting anything. <i>Tomorrow morning I leave for Rosefall</i>, I promised myself. Then I went out for what I feared might be my final dinner.</p><p></p><p>I went to the farmer’s market near the docks. It was the most popular in Epinhoff, and it was heaving with people. Humans are all so tall and so clumsy with their feet, I could hardly get to any stalls without being trampled. Every time I darted in for food I was swatted away by a disgusted stallman, worried I’d ruin their customers’ appetites. Truth be told, rats were more welcome than goblins in those parts. Eventually an old halfling with a kind face and sad eyes sold me a soggy, lukewarm pastry. I chowed down and moved on to the next square over. Traders and merchants were there, and I hoped their gag reflexes were stronger.</p><p></p><p>As I exited a throughway to get to the square, I saw a small herbalism shop between a baker’s and a butcher’s. I peered in through the window, but it was so dark I could only see my reflection. <i>Already closed. Shit.</i> As I cursed, something in the reflection caught my eye. A face over my shoulder, shining in the crowd. A face I recognised. My heart stopped in my chest.</p><p></p><p>Evangeline Whiteheart.</p><p></p><p>I instantly knew she was there for the same job as me. In our industry, there’s no avoiding it; if one Hag gets a tip, they all do. Don’t ask me how, they have their ways. Knowing things is the name of the game. The next most important thing is speed. If Evangeline beat me to Rosefall, I knew I’d be left empty handed.</p><p></p><p>I instinctively spun around and looked at her. She hadn’t seen me, but I stared for too long, and my gaze drew hers. Her face lit up at the sight of me, and she bounded over like a puppy.</p><p></p><p>I looked her up and down as she approached. What I saw made me sick to my stomach.</p><p></p><p>Crystal blue eyes shone atop her perfectly cut cheekbones, framed by luscious golden locks cascading down to her hips. Rosy cheeks blushed through her dainty pale complexion, and, to top it all off, she had a smile to die for. It could surely melt the heart of any man.</p><p></p><p>But I wasn’t a man, and I wasn’t nearly so stupid. I was a goblin, and I saw through her gorgeous, perfect, ridiculously hot facade, all the way down to the hideous, revolting, piece-of-shit personality underneath. It would reveal itself any second now. I knew it.</p><p></p><p>“Hi, Jinx!” she said excitedly. “How have you been?” Her smile was beaming, and her eyes were gleaming. She fluttered her eyelashes, and my heart fluttered with them. Not today, Mephistopheles.</p><p></p><p>“Yeah, yeah. Spare me the pleasantries, you roach,” I replied. “What are you doing here? Collecting children’s tears for supper?”</p><p></p><p>She looked hurt, but I reminded myself that monsters don’t have feelings. “I see you’re still upset with me. I was afraid you might be.” She lowered her eyes. “I’m sorry about what happened, Jinx. I really am. But you know you would have done the same. Please, let’s just put it behind us. I desperately want to fix this.”</p><p></p><p>“Fix my ass,” I said, and cocked a leg as I ripped a fart. Perfect timing, as it was slipping out anyway.</p><p></p><p>Still, she remained earnest. “You know, I’ve done a lot of thinking since our last encounter. I almost reached out to you a few times to apologise, but… I worried it would make you angry.”</p><p></p><p>“Yet here you are, glued to my tail like a tick to a dog.”</p><p></p><p>“No, Jinx! It’s not like that at all,” she said. “I’m not following you.”</p><p></p><p>“Said every stalker ever.”</p><p></p><p>“Be that as it may, I swear that I’m not. I’m here to stock up and rest. Things have been too heated for my liking. I’m laying low for a while, trying to stay out of trouble. I guess you’re doing the same.”</p><p></p><p>“Yeah,” I said. “Pretty much.” We were both lying, and we both knew it. It’s a strange thing when you know someone that well; it was as though we could read each other’s minds. I’d predict her every move, her predictions about mine, and her predictions about my predictions. It was like pointing two mirrors at one another; there was no end to the complexity.</p><p></p><p>Then it occurred to me that she might <i>actually</i> be reading my mind. <i>Balls!</i> I thought loudly. <i>Big hairy balls!</i></p><p></p><p>She smiled at me.</p><p></p><p>“Anyway,” I continued, “I can’t say it’s been a pleasure, but I’ve got things to do. Hopefully see you never, though I highly doubt it.” I pushed past her through a cloud of floral perfume.</p><p></p><p>“Take care, Jinx!”</p><p></p><p> ----</p><p></p><p></p><p>I suppressed my thoughts as I walked away, fearing she might be listening. A devious plan was forming in my mind, but I’d have to be quick  for it to work. I plucked a single brown hair from a woman walking past, and skulked away as she scratched at her scalp.</p><p></p><p>There was an alley nearby with a thick stone arch that bridged between two overhanging buildings (and looked suspiciously critical to their structural integrity). Decorative ridges lined the arch, and the surrounding walls were rough stone brick. They were no match for my goblin claws. I scampered up a wall and hid atop the arch. It was just tall enough and wide enough to obscure me from the street below.</p><p></p><p>I unpacked several spell components from my backpack, and laid them out across the dusty stone. It was a simple spell, and it only took a minute. I placed the hair I had stolen into a vial of weak acid, and while it dissolved I used my pestle and mortar to make a balm of dried lizard skin and squid ink. Then I mixed it all together into a thick, dark paste and spread it across my face, ears and claws. The acid stung my cheeks. I read arcane words from my spellbook to activate the paste, and it spread across my eyes and mouth, clinging to my jaw and stretching around my ears. For a moment, the film engulfed me entirely, and I swallowed back panic as it blocked off my airways. It writhed and tugged on my skin, twisting flesh to rearrange as necessary. I resisted the urge to scream. Finally it settled, and I peeled the black film off my face. I looked into my handmirror, and a handsome woman looked back.</p><p></p><p>Being human is advantageous in many ways, but one thing they are <i>terrible</i> at is climbing. I began to lower myself from the arch, slowly and carefully, but my soft, delicate hands immediately lost traction. I fell, splashing into the mud like a sack of wet shit. A group of children doubled over in laughter across the street.</p><p></p><p>“Fuck you!” I screamed as I clambered to my feet. I must have looked quite unhinged, because they’d run off by the time I was up.</p><p></p><p>I headed back to the square and immediately found Evangeline. She was laughing with one of the merchants; flirting for a discount, no doubt. I pottered around the market, making use of the opportunity to buy food and supplies. When she finally left, I followed from afar.</p><p></p><p>We walked a half-mile north before reaching the posh part of town. It was a nice change of scenery for me. I usually worked in the rougher areas – desperation was good for business after all. I rarely had occasion to go somewhere fancy, and, even if I did, I usually wasn’t welcome. I made the most of my human face and poked it into a bookshop whilst Evangeline stopped at a tailor’s. It was a wonderful little place, and I longed to lose myself in its shelves – but I dared not lose Evangeline.</p><p></p><p>As the sun was setting, we arrived at her lodging. The Golden Goose Inn. Classic Evangeline. She was drawn to shiny things like a magpie. Their brains were similar in size, so it made perfect sense. I took a hard left and set up camp in a nearby alley.</p><p></p><p>It was a good ol’ fashioned stakeout. Not only would I get to keep tabs on her, but whilst she was asleep I could enchant her through a window. Nothing malicious; just an extra dose of beauty sleep. If I could get a half-day’s lead on her, I’d be leaving Rosefall by the time she arrived. I would have loved to see the panic on her face when she realised she’d overslept.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it didn’t work out that way. It was a long, boring night, and my nook was so cosy compared to the flea-riddled haystack I’d grown accustomed to. I couldn’t help but close my eyes for a minute...</p><p></p><p>I woke up to birdsong. The first golden rays of dawn spilled across the inn, painting colour into its gardens and walls. There were no singing children, but that was the only thing missing; other than that, it was basically heaven. I felt better waking up there than I’d felt in weeks. It must be how Evangeline felt every day, the spoilt cow. And then my heart stopped. <i>Evangeline!</i></p><p></p><p>I jumped to my feet as I realised what had happened. That tricksy bitch had used my own plan against me: she’d enchanted me to sleep. There was no other explanation. I never slept that soundly, and there was no such thing as coincidence around Evangeline.</p><p></p><p> ----</p><p></p><p></p><p>It was two days’ travel to Rosefall. I offered a hefty sum to the coachman to run his horses into the ground. He refused, so I offered half as much to at least push them hard. He grunted disgruntledly as he accepted my gold. Regaining a few hours might make all the difference.</p><p></p><p>It was a surprisingly uneventful journey. As we crossed the border into Rosefall’s permanent overcast, I straightened up to keep watch. Traveling through Rosefall is risky for the best of us; if the coachman and I found trouble, we wouldn’t stand a chance. Fortunately, the estate wasn’t far from the border. The vampire who had lived there was young, and too low status for Rosefall’s centre.</p><p></p><p>We crested a ridge that encompassed a forest in the valley far below. In the centre of the forest was a clearing, and in the centre of the clearing was a manor.</p><p></p><p>The horses slowed to a halt, and the coachman grunted. He was the grunting type.</p><p></p><p>“Why are you stopping?” I asked. “Can’t we get a bit closer?”</p><p></p><p>He looked at me with half lidded go-fuck-yourself eyes. I understood perfectly.</p><p></p><p>The walk down the ridge wasn’t a difficult one, but I was impatient to arrive and my rushing exhausted me. I was already winded when I reached the wood’s edge, and as I weaved through the trees my anxiety spurred me faster. It was eerily quiet for a forest. There was not even a wind. By the time I reached the estate, I was panting hard and sweating.</p><p></p><p>But the estate is what really took my breath away. It was magnificent. An army of gargoyles stared down from a black gothic crown of sharply-peaked roofs, which perched atop several curvy stone arches, flowing down like petrified waterfalls. The arches encased a black wooden core, forming a protective stone shell around the heart of the mansion. A hundred terraced windows peppered its front, interrupted only by a mighty wooden gate that sealed it off from the rest of the world. An entire army could live there by my reckoning. I could hardly fathom the loneliness of its sole occupant.</p><p></p><p>I cracked the gate open, and stepped inside. Goosebumps immediately ran up my arms from the freezing air, and my ears began to ring. If the woodland’s silence was eerie, the mansion’s was sinister. I struggled to stifle the sound of my cloudy breath.</p><p></p><p>The interior matched the exterior’s grandiosity, yet it was somehow soulless. A great crystal chandelier hung low from a ludicrously high ceiling, its twinkling reflections dancing across a glassy pool in the room’s centre. Dark wooden gates gaped open behind it, wrapped on each side by twin marble staircases leading up to a mezzanine. I headed for the gate as quietly as I could – which is pretty damn quietly – but the clicking of my claws on the marble floor echoed all around the foyer with every step.</p><p></p><p>The gate lead to a cavernous hall. Three ebony dining tables stretched towards a dais at the far end where a black metal throne looked out across its subjects. As I looked around, I could almost see the ghosts of vampiric parties past. Sure, some atrocities were probably committed – but I still felt a pang of longing to attend. The entire mansion embodied an aesthetic that I found deeply pleasing. I would have loved to admire the attendents’ attire.</p><p></p><p>As I explored the estate further I began to relax. There were numerous living rooms, gothic and lux, and the guest bedrooms were divine (or whatever the vampiric equivalent is). Most rooms were one of the two, but I also found a phenomenal library in the far eastern wing. It was within a building constructed earlier than the rest of the house – that much was clear from its crumbling stone walls. It had much lower ceilings, and it was cramped and busy with bookcases. I could have spent a lifetime there. I’m sure some lucky vampire had spent several. But I couldn’t waste too much time; I was acutely aware of how undisturbed the house was, and I still held out hope that I might be the first one there. I scanned the collection of books, bagged the most promising ones, and moved on.</p><p></p><p>I looped back to the central body of the estate, and began working my way upwards. Spiral staircases punctuated each corner of the great hall. They lead to a balcony that overlooked the hall from all sides, and several enclosed nooks branched off to function as private rooms. As I kept going up, there was a clear threshold between the dark wooden core of the house and the stone upper shell. Only one room occupied both layers. Its walls were part wood and part stone, and it was suspended at a half level that interrupted the regularity of the house. Such an extravagant sign of significance made it easy to guess its contents; I stepped inside the master bedroom.</p><p></p><p>I have always wondered whether vampires truly slept in coffins. On that day I discovered it’s a load of bullshit; the bed in there would have filled any ordinary sized room. Maybe two. But this room was not ordinary sized; it was as extravagantly spacious as the rest of the house. Across from the bed was a large archway that looked like another room, but on closer examination it was an impeccably clean floor-to-ceiling mirror. Dotted around the other walls were dozens of small shelves, clearly intended to hold ornaments and trinkets – but, to my dismay, there were all completely empty. I feared I was too late.</p><p></p><p> I checked the chests, the wardrobe, and every desk drawer. There was nothing worth taking. But as I gazed around the room in desperation, something caught my eye in the huge arched mirror: a single fishbowl, brimmed with water on a shelf. I turned around to find it, but there was nothing there. I looked from the mirror, to the shelf, and back again, and asked myself if I was going crazy. There was <i>definitely</i> a fishbowl in the mirror that wasn’t in the room. I pushed myself right up against the mirror to get a closer look.</p><p></p><p>And then I saw my worst nightmare.</p><p></p><p>Evangeline jumped out behind me and screamed.</p><p></p><p>I jumped away from the mirror in fright, and cursed myself for startling so badly. She was incapacitated with laughter, and I turned around to face her.</p><p></p><p>But she wasn’t there.</p><p></p><p>I turned back to the mirror, and there she was, right over my shoulder. I double took again. “What the fuck is going on?”</p><p></p><p>“You should have seen your face, Jinx!” she said through fits of giggles. “I’ve never seen someone look so scared!”</p><p></p><p>“Well, you must be a very shitty Witch then.” I looked around to try and make sense of everything. It still made no sense. “Evangeline... Why are you in the mirror? <i>How</i> are you in the mirror?”</p><p></p><p>“Ah,” she said, tapping her nose with a smug grin. “Tricks of the trade, my friend. Would you care to join me?”</p><p></p><p>I stood dumbfounded for a second. “Well... yeah.” She beckoned me towards her.</p><p></p><p>I walked straight at the mirror. My head bounced off like a toddler’s.</p><p></p><p>Evangeline collapsed into more fits of laughter. “No, dummy!” she said. “Not like that! Your reflection’s in the way.”</p><p></p><p>I stood dumbfounded once more. Was I having a stroke? Why did she think <i>any</i> of this made sense?</p><p></p><p>“Well how do I get it out the fucking way?” I shouted, anger swelling in my chest. She was making a fool out of me. Stupid, bird-brained Evangeline thought I was dumb.</p><p></p><p>“Do you think a vampire would have this problem?”</p><p></p><p>I thought for a moment. “I don’t know. Aren’t they born without reflections?”</p><p></p><p>She shrugged. “Apparently. I’ve never seen one before.”</p><p></p><p>“Well, how do I get rid of mine?” I asked.</p><p></p><p>“Your reflection does whatever you do. And you need your reflection to disappear. So...”</p><p></p><p>“So what? I need to disappear myself? What does that even <i>mean</i>?”</p><p></p><p>She touched her nose, pointed at me, and bounced up and down with glee. “Yes! That’s it! Disappear yourself!”</p><p></p><p>“I’ll disappear you in a minute you fucking-”</p><p></p><p>I paused. Cogs turned in my head. It took far too long for them to click into place.</p><p></p><p>“Ah,” I said. “I see.”</p><p></p><p>Evangeline clapped with delight.</p><p></p><p>I took components from my bag and set them out across the floorboards. After a minute of arranging and reciting from my spellbook, I cast a spell that did exactly what she said. I turned myself invisible.</p><p></p><p>Then I walked through the mirror.</p><p></p><p>Evangeline clapped more with a beaming smile on her face. “You did it! This is <i>so</i> much fun!”</p><p></p><p>I turned off my invisibility and looked at the mirror behind me. There was no reflection. “Yeah,” I admitted through a reluctant smile. “This is pretty cool.”</p><p></p><p>I looked around the room. It was still barren, except for a fishbowl on one shelf, and a scroll on a chest next to the mirror.</p><p></p><p>And a huge bulging sack in the corner.</p><p></p><p>“Um. Evangeline…” I said tentatively. “Is that yours?”</p><p></p><p>“Yep!” she said with a proud grin.</p><p></p><p>“Did you stuff it full of loot from the shelves?”</p><p></p><p>“That’s right!” she said proudly.</p><p></p><p>“Oh. Cool.” It was going to be a tricky negotiation. “And… are you planning to share any of it?”</p><p></p><p>She gave me a knowing look. “Oh, Jinx. Of course I am. We’re friends after all, right?”</p><p></p><p>I forced myself to swallow my pride and say it. “Yeah. That’s right.”</p><p></p><p>“Best of friends. Right?”</p><p></p><p>I paused, and thought to myself, <i>Are you fucking insane? We’re mortal enemies, you dumb bitch.</i> Then I said, “That’s right. We’re best of friends.”</p><p></p><p>“Good.” She smiled, satisfied. “I know how hard that was for you, but it’s nice to hear it every once in a while. I just need your help with one more thing before we leave. You see that fishbowl over there?”</p><p></p><p>“That one?” I turned around to face it. “It’s empty.”</p><p></p><p>“Yeah, I know it looks that way. But there’s something in the water, and I can’t get it out.”</p><p></p><p>“Oh… okay. Cool.” I walked towards the fish bowl. <i>Is this a bad idea?</i> I wondered. <i>More nonsensical reflective shenanigans, perhaps?</i> I didn’t really have much choice; she had all the loot. Until she handed some over, I was basically her bitch.</p><p></p><p>I stood in front of the fish bowl.</p><p></p><p>I leaned over it, and peered into the water.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing there.</p><p></p><p>“Evangeline,” I said. “Are you sure there’s something in here? You know, other than water?”</p><p></p><p>“Yep! Just pop back over here for a sec.”</p><p></p><p>“Kay.”</p><p></p><p>I walked back to Evangeline in a daze. My cloak was slightly damp.</p><p></p><p>“I’m going to need you to trust me now, Jinx,” she said slowly. “There’s something inside you, and I’m going to pull it out.”</p><p></p><p>My eyes bulged. “What? What are you talking about?”</p><p></p><p>“Something got inside your skull. I’m going to pull it out. Hold still.”</p><p></p><p>“Wait a sec-”</p><p></p><p>She put her hand up to my face and cast a spell.</p><p></p><p>I felt something dislodge in the top of my nose. Like a giant snot-ball I hadn’t noticed. It was bulging and slimy and tasted like metal.</p><p></p><p>And then it started to writhe.</p><p></p><p>I screamed. My eyes went wide. Blind panic seized my chest. I had no idea what she was doing, but there was <i>definitely</i> something in my nose.</p><p></p><p>“Get it out! <i>Get it out!</i>” I screamed at her.</p><p></p><p>“I’m trying! Hold still!”</p><p></p><p>Pressure built up in my nose, and pain soon followed. I felt the crunching and crackling of cartilage shifting. Then, finally, in a mighty explosion of thick snot and blood, a clear gelatin ball erupted from my face. Evangeline caught it in one hand.</p><p></p><p><i>“Fuck!”</i> I screamed, clutching my nose. Blood poured through my claws onto the floorboards.</p><p></p><p>“Yikes,” said Evangeline. “That was worse than I thought. Sorry, Jinx.”</p><p></p><p>“What the fuck was that?!” I screamed.</p><p></p><p>“It’s called a mind maggot. See here?” She held up a watery transparent slug in front of me. Five whisker-like tendrals wriggled at one end, grasping out for prey.</p><p></p><p>“What the fuck? What <i>is</i> that?”</p><p></p><p>“It’s a funny little creature,” she said. “It’s a parasite occasionally found in stagnant bodies of water in the Underdark. It forces its way up the host’s nose towards the brain, and extends antennae into the brain stem. Once inside, it can alter your memories. The first thing it does is make you forget its presence – and then you don’t stand a chance of removing it! It can make you do whatever it needs in order to reproduce, and all the while you have no idea it’s there.” She beamed at me, her inner girl scout shining through. “Pretty cool, huh?”</p><p></p><p>I looked at her blankly. The top of my nose throbbed with pain.</p><p></p><p>I bent over and threw up.</p><p></p><p>As I stood back up, Evangeline rubbed my back sympathetically. I appreciated that.</p><p></p><p>“So,” I croaked hoarsely, “if you’ve had your fun, shall we split up that loot now?”</p><p></p><p>“Sure,” she said with a smile. She walked over to her sack and pulled out a metal canister. “Yours is over there.” She pointed at the scroll on the chest of drawers, then opened the canister, and smoke poured from within.</p><p></p><p>I blacked out.</p><p></p><p> ----</p><p></p><p></p><p>There was knocking. I opened my eyes, and looked around for its source. A party of five adventurers stood staring at me from the far side of the mirror, their reflections not too far from me.</p><p></p><p>“We’re, urr… looking for loot,” said a particularly burly one. “You wouldn’t happen to know where it is, would ya?”</p><p></p><p>I looked around in a daze. My nose throbbed as I moved my head. Splatters of blood were dried on the floorboards. The empty fishbowl was still on its shelf. But Evangeline and her sack were gone.</p><p></p><p>I stood up and walked to the chest of drawers, scanning the party as I went. They were carrying an awful lot of weapons. An <i>awful</i> lot.</p><p></p><p>“Hey. Did you hear us, goblin?” said a dwarf with a huge hammer.</p><p></p><p>I picked up the scroll on the chest. It was a spell scroll: Teleport. There was a note clipped to its front, saying:</p><p></p><p></p><p className="tab"><i>Sorry! :p hehe x</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>I tossed my head back, and groaned. It reverberated through the depths of my soul. Embarrassed, swindled, and patronised with charity. It was the lowest point in my career. I hated myself vehemently for losing to Evangeline again. I swore to myself that I would one day destroy her.</p><p></p><p>“Wait... Stop!” the dwarf objected as I read aloud the words on the scroll.</p><p></p><p>It burnt up in a blinding flash of green light, and then I was gone.</p></>);export default content;
