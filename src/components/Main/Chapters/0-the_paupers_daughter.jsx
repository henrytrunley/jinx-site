`Heed the tale o'the greedy pauper
Thought that wealth would end his torture
Sought help from a clever Witch
To strike a deal to make him rich

The Witch would give him slaves and land
With goblins bound to his command
But in exchange the pauper swore
To give the Witch his own firstborn

With money, power, slaves galore
The pauper bought himself a whore
The pauper took her to his bed 
On morrow they'd be newly-wed

A honeymoon, nine months of smiles
Until arrival of their child
When pauper suffered change of heart 
From child he could not bear to part

And so the pauper broke his deal
In vain, attempting to conceal 
But when the Witch learnt of his daughter
Came the downfall of the pauper

The Witch was smart, the Witch was quick
The Witch devised a nasty trick
Despite his lies, despite his debt
She made the pauper one last bet:

"Amongst your slaves, the goblin crowd
I’ll hide the child you once had vowed
You keep her if you pick her out
But miss the child, and you'll keep nout"

The pauper smiled, smug with glee
He was naive, he could not see
The rotten deal that sought to rob him
As his child became a goblin

He cursed, and raged, and begged, and cried
He cursed his greed, he cursed his lies,
He cursed the Witch, himself, his life
The Witch’s curse fed off his strife

From rags to riches, back to rags
She took it all, the evil hag
So heed his tale, and spare a thought for
Jinx, the pauper's goblin daughter`
